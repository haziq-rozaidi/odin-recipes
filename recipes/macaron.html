        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A macaron or French macaron is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food colouring. The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici during the Renaissance.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; quickly fold almond mixture into egg whites, about 30 strokes.</li>
            <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</li>
            <li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cookies cool completely before filling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
